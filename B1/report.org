* Dataset
** Overview
This dataset consists of the population breakdown of Singapore from 2000 to 2020. The data fields that are of interest here are:

| Field     | Description                                           | Data Type |
|-----------+-------------------------------------------------------+-----------|
| Year      | Year                                                  | Integer   |
| Group     | Denoting the residents that are included in the group | String    |
| Age Group | Age group                                             | String    |

* Purpose of Visualisation
For this dataset, the query of interest is: "How fast is Singapore's population ageing? Is ageing population really a huge issue?"
* Visualisation
** Comparison of Population Pyramid across 2000, 2010, and 2020

[[./charts/Pyramid.png]]

- Visual encoding here includes:
  + Length - Denoting the amount of residents (male/female) for each age group
  + Color - Differentiating the year - 2000/2010/2020
  + Position - Denoting the age group
- Insights
  + Clearly, the number of elderly are increasing rather substantially across the decades whereas the converse is not true for young adults
** Old Age Support Ratio

[[./charts/old age support ratio.png]]

- As the name implies, old age support ratio is the ratio of working adults to elderly
- An area chart was chosen to emphasise the decreasing pattern across time.
- Visual encoding here includes:
  + Position - Denoting the ratio
- Insights
  + From the chart, it is evident how this is decreasing over time at a very steady pace
** Percentage of elderly amongst the population across time

[[./charts/% elderly.png]]

- An area chart was chosen to emphasise the increasing percentage across time.
- Visual encoding here includes:
  + Position - Denoting the percentage of elderly amongst the population
- Insights
  + The rate of increase seems to be picking up in recent years which is concerning
