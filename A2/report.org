* Dataset
** Overview
The initial dataset consists of the GDP for each country from 1960s all the way to 2020. Here, I chose to focus instead on the GDP for each country in the year 2020 and show the distribution of GDP across countries instead. The data of interest is the following:

| Field   | Description                                  | Data Type                 |
|---------+----------------------------------------------+---------------------------|
| Year    | Financial Year                               | Integer                   |
| Rank    | Rank of the country based on their total GDP | Integer (starting from 0) |
| Country | Name of country                              | String                    |
| State   | The region/continent the country belongs to  | String                    |
| GDP     | The total amount of GDP for that year        | Integer                   |

This dataset is interesting in that it allows us to analyse the popularity and trends in the anime industry across many different years and seasons.

* Purpose of Visualisation
For this dataset, the query of interest is: "What is the distribution of GDP like across the countries? Which countries are the biggest/smallest financially in terms of total GDP?"

* Visualisation
** GDP per country (in millions) in 2020

[[./charts/gdp_per_country.png]]

- A horizontal bar chart was chosen here to show the GDP per country
  + Note: The image was cut off slightly when saving to pdf/screenshot, please load and view the actual webpage instead.
- Visual encoding here includes:
  + Length - Denoting the total amount of GDP for that country in year 2020
** Global Distribution of GDP

[[./charts/gdp_sunburst.png]]

- A sunburst chart was chosen to show both the distribution/percentages of GDP across the countries as well as across regions.
  + Note: The image was cut off slightly when saving to pdf/screenshot, please load and view the actual webpage instead.
- Visual encoding here includes:
  + Length - Denoting the percentage of total GDP globally that the country makes up
  + Color - Differentiating the regions
- Insights
  + From the chart, it is evident how United States and China alone makes up for approximately a third of the world's GDP.
** Regional Distribution of GDP (in millions) in 2020
[[./charts/gdp_boxplot.png]]
- A boxplot was chosen here to show the distribution/stats of GDP spread across various regions.
- Visual encoding here includes:
  + Position - Denoting the amount of GDP
- Insights
  + Of particular interest is that outliers aside, the region "America" does not actually do very well in spite of United States ranking first in terms of total GDP.
  + It is also quite fascinating to see that Europe fared the best when looking at median and the interquartile range.
